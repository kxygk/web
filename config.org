This is the common export configuration for all of my project/webpages so that they all have a consistent look and can be tweaked from one place

This file is mean to be included at the top of project level =.org= files with a
~#+INCLUDE: "../web/config.org"~
And root level files with a
~#+INCLUDE: "../web/config.org"~

For project README.org files there needs to be an addition:
~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: index.html~

#+html_doctype: html5
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../web/kxygk.css" />
#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <link rel="shortcut icon" href="../web/panda.svg" type="image/x-icon">
#+HTML_MATHJAX: path: "../MathJax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_CHTML"

This last #+PROPERTY block enables the export of RESULTS blocks. Normally they're not exported to the HTML

NOTE:  ~:results org~ removed b/c I have org mode blocks try to execute..
